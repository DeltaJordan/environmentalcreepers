# [Environmental Creepers 1.7.10 Unofficial Backport]()
Forked version of [Environmental Creepers](https://github.com/maruohon/environmentalcreepers)
backported to 1.7.10. This was made possible with the help of the
[GregTech: New Horizons Example Mod](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/ExampleMod1.7.10).

## Requirements
- [GTNHLib](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTNHLib)
  - Used for the simplification of configuration reading and writing.

## Download
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/environmental-creepers-backport)

## Differences Between Official and This Version
There currently is not a command to reload the config while a world is
loaded. Otherwise, everything else should work the same as the original
mod. If it doesn't feel free to create an issue detailing what went wrong.

## Original Mod Description
A small mod for Minecraft that allows tweaking some aspects of Creeper explosions and other explosions,
like the chance to drop the blocks as items or disable damage to item entities.
